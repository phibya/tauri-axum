Based on the log files, I can see that:

1. The Rust project has been successfully built - the model-server binary exists in target/debug/
2. The model server has been started multiple times and is functioning properly
3. The server successfully loaded the Llama model from /Users/bya/Downloads/2f5623ae-0f29-404e-a80f-d2f357d8817a
4. The model is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
5. Multiple successful text generation requests have been processed

From the detailed logs, I can see:
- Model config: vocab_size=32000, hidden_size=2048
- The model is generating coherent responses like "I am doing well, thank you. How about you?" for "Hello" prompts
- The streaming functionality appears to be working as evidenced by the step-by-step token generation logs
- Temperature and token sampling is working correctly
- EOS token detection is functioning properly

The streaming API endpoint is available at: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions

Due to shell environment issues, I cannot execute the curl command directly, but based on the server logs showing successful request processing, the API should respond to:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "test-llama",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 5,
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "stream": true
  }'

Expected response format should be streaming JSON chunks containing the generated tokens.
